This is program for renaming image files by their last written date.

It rename all files with types: ".jpg", ".jpeg", ".png" in the folder and in the subfolders(except folders, whose names include "."), to name in format "YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM.filetype".

It using "windows.h", thus I think this works only on Windows.

Excuse me for my english.
